# Wikipedia to Markdown Converter

This script converts any Wikipedia article into a clean, **Obsidian-compatible Markdown file**, preserving structure, references, images, and (optionally) tables from the official PDF export. It is designed to be **robust, polite to Wikipedia servers**, and easy to use.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Accurate Markdown Structure:** Converts Wikipedia headings (`h1`‚Äì`h6`) into Markdown (`#`‚Äì`######`), with lists and paragraphs preserved.
* **Obsidian-Compatible Images:** Extracts images into `![alt text](image_url)` format.
* **Inline References Preserved:** Inline citation markers (e.g., `[1]`) are escaped as `\[1]`.
* **Reference Section:** Appends a `## References` section with numbered footnotes.
* **Optional PDF Table Extraction:** Downloads the Wikipedia PDF and extracts tabular data as Markdown tables (with proper spacing for Obsidian).
* **Safe HTTP Requests:** Uses a descriptive `User-Agent`, request timeouts, and retry with exponential backoff (for compliance with Wikimedia API policies).
* **Flexible CLI Options:**

  * `--no-pdf` ‚Üí skip PDF download/table extraction.
  * `-o` / `--outdir` ‚Üí choose output directory (default: `~/Downloads`).
  * `--stop` ‚Üí stop processing at extra section headings (e.g., `"External links"`).
* **Clean Output:** Saves the final `.md` file with the article title as the filename.

## üìÑ Output Example

The Markdown file will include:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Notes

* The script uses the [Wikipedia REST API PDF endpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/Page%20content/get_page_pdf__title_) for tables.
* Requests are retried on transient errors (429, 503, etc.) with exponential backoff.
* Please replace the placeholder contact in the `User-Agent` string with your own (email or website), per Wikimedia API policy.
